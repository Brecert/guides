# What is this?

This repository is a temporary station for my various guides on the forums. I have been experiencing severe load times on the forums, thus I had to move the guides elsewhere in order to update them to 1.13. Unfortunately this location is not the easiest place to ask any questions, so feel free to continue using the forum threads listed below or ask in the [/r/MinecraftCommands](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/) subreddit (or [its corresponding Discord server](https://discord.gg/QAFXFtZ)).

In the future these guides will be moved once again to a more permanent location.
